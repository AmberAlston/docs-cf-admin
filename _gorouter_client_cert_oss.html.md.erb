Operators may change this behavior with the property `router.client_cert_validation`. This property accepts the following values:

* `none`: The Gorouter does not request client certificates in TLS handshakes. Since client certificates are not requested, clients do not provide them. Therefore, validation of client certificates does not occur. This option is incompatible with `forwarded_client_cert: forward` or `forwarded_client_cert: sanitize_set` XFCC configurations because these options require mutual authentication. 
* `request`: The Gorouter requests client certificates in TLS handshakes, validates them when presented, but does not require them. This is the default configuration.
* `require`: The Gorouter fails the TLS handshake if the client does not provide a certificate signed by a CA that the Gorouter trusts. Select this option if your load balancer terminates TLS and does not require client certificates, and the load balancer provides a compatible client certificate of its own to Gorouter in an independent TLS handshake. This option may also be selected for Isolation Segments when Gorouter is the first point of TLS termination. Many clients of CF platform APIs do not present client certificates in TLS handshakes, so the first point of TLS termination for requests to the system domain must not require them.
